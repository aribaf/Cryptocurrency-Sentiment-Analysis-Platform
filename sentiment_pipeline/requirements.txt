# Web Scraping Libraries
playwright  # Used for news scraping
selenium    # Used for tweet scraping
# Note: Playwright usually requires installing browser executables separately: `playwright install`

# NLP/Sentiment Analysis Libraries
transformers # Core library for FinBERT model
torch        # The underlying ML framework required by transformers (PyTorch)
# Note: Use the specific torch package for your environment (e.g., torch==2.x.x+cu118 for CUDA)

# Database Connector
pymongo      # MongoDB driver (includes required dependencies for MongoDB Atlas/SRV URIs)

# Configuration Management
python-dotenv # Used to load environment variables from a .env file

# Other useful packages that might be implicitly required or good to have:
# lxml (sometimes used by playwright/selenium for parsing)
# sentencepiece (common dependency for transformer models)
# protobuf (common dependency for transformer models)
```

## Recommended `requirements.txt`

For a robust and functional environment, here is the consolidated and refined list of dependencies you should use in your `requirements.txt` file:

```
# Core Libraries
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# MongoDB Driver
pymongo

# Web Scraping Tools
playwright
selenium
supervisor
# NLP/Machine Learning Stack
# Note: You may need to replace 'torch' with the specific version 
# that supports your environment (e.g., CUDA) for best performance.
transformers
torch

# Configuration
python-dotenv

# Common underlying dependencies often required by the ML/NLP stack
# You can remove these if you prefer to rely on `transformers` installation
# to pull them in, but including them ensures direct installation.
# sentencepiece
# protobuf
